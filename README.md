# MyPortfolio
 A portfolio website I;m building using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer-Motion. I'm followed along to a tutorial to make the initial site, and will be branching off to make it my own. I hope to also integrate Three.js and Spline in order to have some cool 3D parts on the site!
